# PASSWORD GENERATOR
This project was awesome! One of the most valuable tools I learned while doing research was the ".fromCharCode" method. It in combination with "const" (which should totally be taught in the lesson, maybe it will be later) and the .concat made generating this project very simple, for me at least. I have a small background in Java so the logic and variable portions were easy enough. I had a blast figuring out how to use the .fromCharCode to make a nice clean final product.
